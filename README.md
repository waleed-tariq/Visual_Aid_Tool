# Visual Aid Tool

This is the code that goes along with the machine I created. It is controlled through an Arduino. This machine contains three linear actuator servo motors, an ultrasonic sensor, an Arduino Leonardo, and a breadboard. Based on the data received from the ultrasonic sensor, the three motors will act. If the sensor detects an object at a far distance one motor will move and poke the user in the hand. If the sensor detects an object at a closer distance, another motor will move forward and poke the user. If the sensor detects an object at a very close distance, the final motor will move forward and poke the user. At the end the user will feel three pokes and know to change their course of direction to avoid the object.
